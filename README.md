# First Fast-API Project

## Introduction

This is the first Fast-API project.  It is a simple REST API that returns based on three options:

    - /meme - returns a random meme
    - /fact/topic - returns a random fact about the topic
    - /top_stocks - returns the top stocks for the day

## This project has no bearing and is just a practice/hobby project
